#Lecture Notes: Merge Sort
This algorithm is is about sort the given int array.

## Learning Objectives
To learn the use of insertionSort method that sorts the given int array

## Lecture Flow
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. <br/>
Sorting is important in programming as it makes it  easier and faster to locate items when it is sorted.
   
###Another main point
More details<br/>
If the data are sorted it is easier to analyse duplicate entities. <br/>
If the data are sorted it is easier to compare two arrays. <br/>
If the data are sorted it is easier to find any int in that array. <br/>

## Algorithm
Describe in detail how the algorithm works. Include small code snippets to possibly support the points
